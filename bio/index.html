          songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his

          Luong was born in Houston, Texas, to Vietnamese parents and grew up in
          nearby Sugar Land. Despite living in an ethnically diverse community
          with a large Asian population, he recalls that he often felt out of
          place and disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as others
          around him were mostly ethnically Chinese. When he was 13, he began
          learning the guitar after picking it up from his grandfather. He began
          teaching himself the instrument while using his grandfather’s
          Vietnamese music book. Another one of his motivations for learning
          guitar came from watching Drake Bell from the Nickelodeon TV show
          Drake & Josh attract girls through his guitar skills. In his early
          years playing guitar and writing music, he cites John Mayer and Ed
          Sheeran as his biggest influences. He graduated from Stephen F. Austin
          High School in Sugar Land and earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing
          from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an oncology
          nurse at the Texas Medical Center for two years. The name “Keshi”
          comes from the childhood name that his girlfriend’s parents gave him.
          They have been childhood friends since 5th or 6th grade, and he would
          go over to her house every day. When he visited, her parents would
          call him “Keshi,” which they still do to this day.

          During college, he created his moniker “Keshi”, and began to share
          music via his SoundCloud page. He credited watching YouTube tutorials
          for teaching himself writing, producing, performing and engineering
          his music. Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical
          direction, but slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy
          vocals combined with lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention
          and popularity. In 2017, he quit his job as a nurse and flew to New
          York City to sign with Island Records. His decision to quit nursing
          and the pursuit of music was ultimately made due to his realization
          that the fear of missed opportunities exceeded his fear of failure.
          From there, his first singles attracted millions of listeners upon
          release. He cites John Mayer, Frank Ocean, The 1975, Drake, and Bryson
          Tiller as some of his greatest musical influences.

          <h2 class="sub foreground">Q&A with Keshi</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>What’s your favorite song of yours?</h3>
        <p>HELL/HEAVEN</p>
        <h3>How many tattoos do you have?</h3>
        <p>
          My sleeve on my right arm is a traditional Japanese sleeve I got in
          Shinjuku. The other is Zodiac signs of my family.
        </p>
        <h3>How many people have you kissed?</h3>
        <p>Maybe six or seven people.</p>
        <h3>What’s on your bucket list?</h3>
        <p>
          I’d really like to have a cat, but that's living life on the edge
          'cause I’m allergic.
        </p>
        <h3>How did Keshi get discovered?</h3>
        <p>
          I made keshi in college as an anonymous SoundCloud account 'cause I
          wanted to learn how to produce, just not in the eye of family and
          friends. I felt that validation from strangers or people from the
          Internet meant way more than people who knew you were trying to save
          your feelings or like falsely make you think that you were doing a
          good job and maybe you weren't.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s the best piece of advice another musician ever gave you?</h3>
        <p>
          I think one of the most important pieces of advice that I got recently
          was from Madeon and we hadn't even started working on a track together
          yet. I think we were just getting introduced to each other. I was
          telling him that I was just getting started on working on an album and
          I was scared out of my mind, I was scared to go into the studio, which
          is in my home. I just didn't want to walk in for weeks at a time. I
          was afraid of not being able to make anything. I told him that and he
          said that I didn't need to be so worried about making a cohesive work
          of art; Just make art and the cohesiveness will reveal itself. It made
          zero sense to me as someone who was like 2 tracks deep, but in
          hindsight, I don't even know why I was worried to begin with. It meant
          a lot that he went out of his way to try to assuage my fears, so shout
          out to Maddeon and thank you for being a cool friend.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s the weirdest thing about you?</h3>
        <p>
          It’s not like supreme OCD; If you're driving on the highway and you
          pass like a lot of signs, I have to blink at every sign. It's weird
          things like that. Or if I'm walking and there's tiles on the floor
          like I can't step on the lines, I have to step on the tiles
          themselves, and have to skip every other one. In the same vein, if I'm
          humming music but I can't hum I use my teeth and I know that sounds
          really weird.
