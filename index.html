    <h1>KESHI</h1>
    <p>
      After six EPs showcasing keshi’s flexibility in songwriting and
      production, GABRIEL marks his debut into the studio album world. Producer
      Elie Rizk played the role of executive producer for the album. Word about
      an album first sprung in an October 2019 interview with Radio Heatwave,
      where keshi said: “It is one of my biggest challenges and dreams to make
      an album that is cohesive through-and-through that is meant to be listened
      from beginning to end. That has always been the goal since Continuum and
      Battle Studies and Blonde and TRAPSOUL and Take Care, like they all have
      this top-to-bottom sort of aspect to it.” However, it was first formally
      announced in a celebratory post regarding the release of his sixth EP
      always, where he says: “I wanted skeletons, bandaids & always to be an
      introduction to who I am as an artist. Now that they’re done, it’s time to
      start working on the album.”
