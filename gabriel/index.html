        </div>
        <p>
          I was in a really dry place after the always EP. I knew that it was
          time to make the album, and I didn’t know where to start. I wanted to
          make something cohesive and poignant. But I was lost. I went to the
          Rolling Stone Top 500 Albums list, and listened to tons of music.
          Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Beach Boys, Prince, Marvin Gaye, Beatles… And I
          just found that there’s no one “rule.” Everyone just does what they do
          relentlessly and unapologetically. That was liberating and paralyzing
          at the same time because I had no idea what I wanted to write about.
          It wasn’t until I talked with [collaborator] Madeon, and he was like,
          “Don’t be scared. Don’t be worried about cohesiveness. It’ll reveal
          itself to you in time, and you will be fine” that I was relieved.
          That’s how I was able to get started. The writing process was split
          between Houston and L.A. I would go to L.A. and stay with Elie for two
          weeks. While there, it was about getting crazy beats and sounds.
          Anytime I would write it would put a pause on the momentum, and I
          didn’t want there to be a stop. I was like, “I can’t write with other
          people. Don’t worry about it, let me take this home.” Once I got home
          to Houston, that’s when all the writing happened. I would knock out
          song after song and then go back to L.A. It was a back and forth for
          the whole year. I started in January and ended around July.
