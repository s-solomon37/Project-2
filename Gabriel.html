    I was in a really dry place after the always EP. I knew that it was time to
    make the album, and I didn’t know where to start. I wanted to make something
    cohesive and poignant. But I was lost. I went to the Rolling Stone Top 500
    Albums list, and listened to tons of music. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Beach Boys,
    Prince, Marvin Gaye, Beatles… And I just found that there’s no one “rule.”
    Everyone just does what they do relentlessly and unapologetically. That was
    liberating and paralyzing at the same time because I had no idea what I
    wanted to write about. It wasn’t until I talked with [collaborator] Madeon,
    and he was like, “Don’t be scared. Don’t be worried about cohesiveness.
    It’ll reveal itself to you in time, and you will be fine” that I was
    relieved. That’s how I was able to get started. The writing process was
    split between Houston and L.A. I would go to L.A. and stay with Elie for two
    weeks. While there, it was about getting crazy beats and sounds. Anytime I
    would write it would put a pause on the momentum, and I didn’t want there to
    be a stop. I was like, “I can’t write with other people. Don’t worry about
    it, let me take this home.” Once I got home to Houston, that’s when all the
    writing happened. I would knock out song after song and then go back to L.A.
    It was a back and forth for the whole year. I started in January and ended
    around July.
