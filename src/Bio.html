    <h1>“I created Keshi as a veil.”</h1>
    <p>
      Casey Luong (born November 4, 1994), known mononymously by his stage name
      keshi (stylized in all lowercase), is an American singer, songwriter,
      record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his distant falsetto
      vocals and textural instrumentals, he has accumulated over 1 billion
      streams with songs such as like I need u, 2 Soon and right here.

      Luong was born in Houston, Texas, to Vietnamese parents and grew up in
      nearby Sugar Land. Despite living in an ethnically diverse community with
      a large Asian population, he recalls that he often felt out of place and
      disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as others around him were
      mostly ethnically Chinese. When he was 13, he began learning the guitar
      after picking it up from his grandfather. He began teaching himself the
      instrument while using his grandfather’s Vietnamese music book. Another
      one of his motivations for learning guitar came from watching Drake Bell
      from the Nickelodeon TV show Drake & Josh attract girls through his guitar
      skills. In his early years playing guitar and writing music, he cites John
      Mayer and Ed Sheeran as his biggest influences. He graduated from Stephen
      F. Austin High School in Sugar Land and earned a Bachelor of Science in
      Nursing from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an
      oncology nurse at the Texas Medical Center for two years. The name “Keshi”
      comes from the childhood name that his girlfriend’s parents gave him. They
      have been childhood friends since 5th or 6th grade, and he would go over
      to her house every day. When he visited, her parents would call him
      “Keshi,” which they still do to this day.

      During college, he created his moniker “Keshi”, and began to share music
      via his SoundCloud page. He credited watching YouTube tutorials for
      teaching himself writing, producing, performing and engineering his music.
      Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical direction, but
      slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy vocals combined with
      lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention and popularity. In 2017,
      he quit his job as a nurse and flew to New York City to sign with Island
      Records. His decision to quit nursing and the pursuit of music was
      ultimately made due to his realization that the fear of missed
      opportunities exceeded his fear of failure. From there, his first singles
      attracted millions of listeners upon release. He cites John Mayer, Frank
      Ocean, The 1975, Drake, and Bryson Tiller as some of his greatest musical
      influences.
