        <p>
          I was in a really dry place after the always EP. I knew that it was time
          to make the album, and I didn’t know where to start. I wanted to make
          something cohesive and poignant. But I was lost. I went to the Rolling
          Stone Top 500 Albums list, and listened to tons of music. Nirvana, Pearl
          Jam, Beach Boys, Prince, Marvin Gaye, Beatles… And I just found that
          there’s no one “rule.” Everyone just does what they do relentlessly and
          unapologetically. That was liberating and paralyzing at the same time
          because I had no idea what I wanted to write about. It wasn’t until I
          talked with [collaborator] Madeon, and he was like, “Don’t be scared.
          Don’t be worried about cohesiveness. It’ll reveal itself to you in time,
          and you will be fine” that I was relieved. That’s how I was able to get
          started. The writing process was split between Houston and L.A. I would
          go to L.A. and stay with Elie for two weeks. While there, it was about
          getting crazy beats and sounds. Anytime I would write it would put a
          pause on the momentum, and I didn’t want there to be a stop. I was like,
          “I can’t write with other people. Don’t worry about it, let me take this
          home.” Once I got home to Houston, that’s when all the writing happened.
          I would knock out song after song and then go back to L.A. It was a back
          and forth for the whole year. I started in January and ended around
          July.
